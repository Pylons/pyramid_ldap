- Python 3 is now supported! This is possible thanks to python-ldap supporting
  python 3

- BREAKING CHANGE: pyramid_ldap now depends on python-ldap >= 3.0, which
  supports python 2 and 3. If you upgrade pyramid_ldap without upgrading
  python-ldap, you will see failures where python-ldap receives text arguments
  instead of bytes. See below for more information.

- python-ldap >= 3.0 stopped accepting `bytes` type arguments for many
  `LDAPObject` methods. We now use the `pyramid.compat.text_` function to
  support text arguments for python 2 and 3.

- The  method typically deals with
  untrusted `login` and `password` inputs (i.e. user inputs).

- In versions 0.2 and lower, invalid LDAP strings passed to
  `pyramid_ldap.Connector.authenticate` would raise `ldap.FILTER_ERROR`. In 0.3
  and up we use `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` to properly escape these prior
  to running the LDAP search. Applications using pyramid_ldap have always been
  responsible for making sure the `login` value fits the `ldap.login_filter_tpl`
  setting in their application. However, if you relied on `ldap.FILTER_ERROR` to
  catch bad username formats (such as `CORP\username`, where the unescaped `\`
  is disallowed in LDAP searches), note that now `authenticate` will return
  `None` instead.
