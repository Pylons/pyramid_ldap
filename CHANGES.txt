Next release
------------

- Support creation of multiple co-existing ldap contexts in the same
  application. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap/pull/6

- Add a "search_after_bind" attribute to the _LDAPQuery class, to
  help in reading directory entry attributes when the directory server
  is configured to hide them in the before login search phase.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap/pull/5

- Set a size limit on pre-login entry dn searches.

- Escape user-provided login names, avoiding server errors or trivial
  DOSs caused by user names like 'user*name' or 'user(middle)name'

- Prevent the use of zero-length password authentication.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap/pull/13
